# Pointer
a variable also known as locator, used to point to the address of a value.

# Reference
a variable which is just the another name of existing variable. (Access a with another reference variable b)

```cpp
& -> Refrencing operator
* -> Defeferencing operator
```

# Advantages of pointers
1. Able to return multiple values from a function.
2. Able to access any memory location.


# Usage of pointers :
Dynamic memory allocation (malloc and calloc)


# Declaration of pointers :
```cpp
   int *a;
   int b = 20
   a = &b;     // stroing address of b
```


# Different types of pointers :
1. void pointer -> Special type of pointers that do not have any data type associated with it. They can point to any datatype. Void pointers are flexible as they can reference any type of datatype.
   Example:
```cpp
      void printValue(void *value, char type) {
         switch (type) {
            case 'i': // integer
                  printf("The integer value is %d\n", *(int*)value);
                  break;
            case 'f': // float
                  printf("The float value is %f\n", *(float*)value);
                  break;
            case 'c': // character
                  printf("The character value is %c\n", *(char*)value);
                  break;
            default:
                  printf("Invalid type\n");
                  break;
         }
      }
```

2. Invalid Pointer -> uninitialized and error creating pointer are Invalid pointers.
Example:
```cpp
   int *a;     // uninitialized pointer = invalid pointer
   int arr[10];
   int *b = (arr+20);   // index out of bound pointing = invalid pointer
```

3. Null pointer -> Pointer that points no where
Example: two different ways to initialize null pointer
```cpp
   int *a = 0;
   int *b = NULL;
```

4. Dangling pointer -> Pointer pointing to memory location that do not exists anymore.
```cpp
int a = 20;
int *b = &a;
delete a;
```


# Call By Value  v/s  Call By Reference (pointers and reference argument)
Example:
```cpp
   int fun(int a){   }        // pass by value -> changes made to a are not refelected in original value

   int fun(int *a){  }     // pass by pointer argument reference -> changes made are reflected in original value.

   int fun(int &a){  }     // pass by reference argument reference -> changes made are reflected in original value.
```


# concept :
```cpp
   int a, *b;
   sizeof(a)   // 4 byte
   sizeof(*b)  // 8 byte
```
```cpp
   int a = 10;
   int &b = a;
   b = 20;
   cout<<a<<endl;    // 20
```


# Pointers v/s References
1. Reassignment is possible with pointers but not with references
   Example:
   ```cpp
      // invalid                       // valid
      int a= 10, c = 20;               int a=10, c = 20;
      int &b = a;                      int *b = &a;
      &b = c;                          *b = &c;
      cout<<b<<endl;                   cout<<*b<<endl;
   ```

2. Memory location is different in case of pointers but same in case of references.

3. Pointers can be assigned with NULL but not references.

4. Pointers to pointers possible but not reference to reference.

5. Arithmetic Operations can be applied on pointers but not on references


# function pointer -> 
Example:
```cpp
   void func1(int *a){  
      cout<<"value is = "<<*a<<endl;
   }
   void func2(void (*funcptr)(int *a)){
      funcptr(a);
   }
```
