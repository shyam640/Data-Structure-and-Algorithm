1. Finding largest and Second largest element in array
         if(a>=g1){
            g2 = g1;
            g1 = a;
         }else if(a>=g2){
            g2 = a;
         }


2. By the triangle inequality, for all real numbers x,y,z, we have:
            |x−y|+|y−z|≥|x−z|
   with equality if and only if min(x,z)≤y≤max(x,z).

   Now, take indices i and j such that ai and aj are the maximum and minimum values of the array, 
   respectively. Then, for each index k, we have ai≥ak≥aj, meaning that 
            |ai−ak|+|ak−aj|=ai−ak+ak−aj=ai−aj=|ai−aj|, 
   as we desired.
